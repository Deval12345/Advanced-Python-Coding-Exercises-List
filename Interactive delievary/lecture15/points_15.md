Title: Capstone Lecture
Point 1: One project tying data model, protocols, descriptors/attributes, functions, decorators, context managers, EAFP, iteration/generators, concurrency.

Slide 1
Title: Project Overview
Point 1: Small data pipeline: read records, validate/transform, write; use iterable or generator, strategy or descriptor, context manager; optional decorator and concurrency.
Point 2: Require: custom class with data model participation, behavior as data, context manager, EAFP, iteration or generator; optional: descriptor, decorator, concurrency with comment.

Slide 2
Title: Suggested Structure
Point 1: Record/Row with *slots*; reader as iterable or generator; validator as callable; context manager for run or file; EAFP in main flow; optional decorator and process pool for CPU step.

Slide 3
Title: Deliverables
Point 1: One module or package, readme listing concepts used; optional tests or run script; evaluated on correct and appropriate use, not maximum features.

Slide 4
Title: Final Takeaways
Point 1: Capstone consolidates the course; build a small pipeline using the right tool for each part; document choices.
