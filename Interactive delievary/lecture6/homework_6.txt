Homework: Decorators and Closures

1. Write a decorator @trace that prints the function name and arguments before each call and the return value after.
2. Implement @cache that memoizes the return value for a function of one argument (use a dict keyed by argument; assume hashable args).
3. Real-world: Build @retry(max_attempts=3) that catches a specific exception, retries up to max_attempts times, and re-raises on final failure. Use a closure to track attempt count.
