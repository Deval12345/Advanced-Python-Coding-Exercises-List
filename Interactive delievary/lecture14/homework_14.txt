Homework: Consolidation (optional)

1. List three industrial use cases (e.g. web API, ETL pipeline, DevOps script) and for each name at least two course concepts that apply.
2. Sketch a one-page design for your capstone pipeline: which class uses the data model, where you will use a context manager, and where EAFP and iteration fit.
3. No coding required; this is preparation for the capstone.
