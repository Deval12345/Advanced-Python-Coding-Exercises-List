Title: Previous Lecture Takeaway
Point 1: Threads for I/O-bound, multiprocessing for CPU-bound; next we consolidate and prepare for the capstone.

Slide 1
Title: How the Pieces Fit
Point 1: Data model and protocols for syntax participation; descriptors and attribute control for frameworks; functions and decorators for behavior injection; context managers and EAFP for resources and errors; iterators and generators for streaming; concurrency for I/O and CPU.
Point 2: Industrial Python uses configuration/descriptors, APIs/protocols, decorators, context managers, generators, threads and process pools together.

Slide 2
Title: Why Python in Industry
Point 1: One language for web, data, DevOps, ML, scripting; same object and concurrency model; readability and maintainability at scale.

Slide 3
Title: What Comes Next
Point 1: Capstone will combine several concepts: custom objects, descriptors or hooks, strategies, decorator or context manager, iteration/generators, and concurrency choice.

Slide 4
Title: Final Takeaways
Point 1: The course concepts form one toolkit; Python in industry relies on this consistent model; capstone ties them into one deliverable.
