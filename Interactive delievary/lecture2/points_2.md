Title: Previous Lecture Takeaway
Point 1: Special methods "__len__", "__getitem__", "__iter__", and "__add__" enable objects to participate in Python syntax and protocols determine compatibility based on behavior

Slide 1
Title: Informal Interfaces

Point 1: Python checks for required behavior at runtime instead of enforcing inheritance

Point 2: Implementing "__len__" and "__getitem__" makes an object behave like a sequence through demonstrated behavior

Slide 2
Title: -
Point 1: Compatibility is determined by capability such as supporting iteration and addition rather than by type or ancestry

Slide 3
Title: -
Point 1: Objects become interchangeable when they share method signatures enabling loosely coupled systems

Slide 4
Title: -
Point 1: Implementing required methods satisfies a protocol without inheritance enforcement

Slide 5
Title: -
Point 1: Python prioritizes behavior, informal interfaces, duck typing, and protocol-driven extensibility where compatibility comes from capability
