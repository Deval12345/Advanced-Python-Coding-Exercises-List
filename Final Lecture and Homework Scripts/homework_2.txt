Refactor an existing class-based design to remove unnecessary inheritance.

Focus on identifying where inheritance was used only for compatibility rather than shared behavior. Replace those relationships with behavior-based design or structural protocols.

Document:
- the original design
- what inheritance was removed
- which behaviors were relied upon instead
- why the new version is clearer, more flexible, or easier to extend

Think in terms of “what methods are required” rather than “what class does this belong to.”
