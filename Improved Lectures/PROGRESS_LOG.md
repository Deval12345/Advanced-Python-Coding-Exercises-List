## File Format Reference

Each lecture should have these files:
- `speech_source_N.md` — CONCEPT/EXAMPLE pairs (synchronization source)
- `speech_N.md` — Full spoken instructor narrative
- `slides_N.md` — Slide bullet points (10-12 slides)
- `code_N.md` — Full code examples with line-by-line explanations
- `homework_N.txt` — 3-4 homework exercises
- `points_N.md` — Key takeaway points

## Content Rules

1. Max ~8 minutes per lecture (roughly 1000-1300 spoken words)
2. Concepts must build step by step — no jumping to future topics
3. Every concept needs: motivation → why it exists → industry use → downside of ignoring it
4. Every code block needs: intro speech + code + line-by-line walkthrough
5. Natural conversational instructor voice throughout
6. Real-world industry use cases throughout

## Session Notes

- Session 1: Lectures 1-10 completed, Lecture 11 partial
- Session 2 (current): Completing Lecture 11 + creating Lectures 12-44
